#Game-Project-Snake-Pit


-Technical Requirements-

Your app must:

-Render a game in the browser.
-Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case.
-Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
-Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation (or HTML canvas for graphics).
-Have a repo on GitHub.
-Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
-Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it.

*Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.

-Deliverables-

-A working game, built by you that runs in the browser.
-A deploy of your game in GitHub Pages.
-The URL of the GitHub repository for your game.
-The URL of the live game on the Internet.
-The URL of the slides for your game’s presentation.
-You must present your game during Project #1 final presentations (last day of Project #1 time).


-Presentations-

For each of the 3 projects you make at Ironhack, you will also have to make a presentation about it. Communication (including public speaking) is an important skill to practice for finding a job after Ironhack.

*Format

-Talking with Slides: 3 minutes
-Demo: 2 minutes
-Total: 5 minutes

*Attire
-Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations (last day of each project’s time).
-Dress at least one degree more elegantly than you usually dress for class.
-Examples:
    -If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
    -If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
    -If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.
    
*Slide Applications

-All presentations will be done from a staff member’s computer, so your slides need to be online.
-PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind will not be accepted.
-Suggested online slide applications:
            Slides
            Prezi
            Google Slides
            
            
-Presentation Structure-

1 Title Slide (1 slide): your project’s name & your name
2 About Me (1-2 slides):
    -Where are you from?
    -What are some interesting facts about you? (hobbies, travels, etc.)
3 Project Elevator Pitch (1-2 slides):
    -What is your project?
    -How does it work?
    -Why did you choose it?
4 Technical Challenge (1-2 slides):
    -What was the most important technical challenge you faced?
    -How did you overcome that challenge?
5 Big Mistake (1-2 slides):
    -What was the biggest mistake you made during this project?
    -What did you learn from it?
6 Demo Slide (1 slide): literally says “DEMO” with a link to your project so you can open it easily
7 Closing Slide (1 slide): your project’s name, your name & a “Thank You”
8 Total: 7-11 slides


Presentation Structure Notes

-Don’t include a slide just for the technologies.
-Don’t include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
-Don’t include a slide for GitHub graphs.
-Don’t go into detail about how the app works. Your demo is where you want to do that.
*If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation, feel free to do so. This suggested structure is mostly for people who don’t know what to do.


Demo Tips

1 Plan what you are going to demo and practice it on the live site. That way you won’t be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2 Deploy early so you can squash bugs. There are always bugs on the live site at first.
3 Add a link to your live project to your DEMO slide so you can start it smoothly.
4 Your app’s colors and sizing might look different on the projector. If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.


__Project Feedback and Evaluation__

Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

Creativity: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something engaging and playable to the end user?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming?

Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public URL using GitHub Pages?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:
Score: Expectation
0:Didn't meet expectations, keep trying
1:Met expectations, good job!
2:Exceeded expectations, you magnificent person!


Good Luck
